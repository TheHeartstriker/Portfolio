# Portfolio

A fun playground made to display of all my projects and skills I have accumulated (: Hosted on azure! Built to be fun to visit for anyone not just a boring sell of myself but a show of vision and evolution

## Where its going

I still plan on adding lots of fun stuff. Currently the main attention grabber Is the about page its has text blurbs that have friction, velocity, gravity(if needed) and can be throw around. A similar system was ported over to the contact's page
which has like 20 or so balls with links to my github and linkedin. I want to add square collisions for the folders on the skills page, shadows in the about page for the blurb and text collisions. I was also thinking about using c++ and wasm if needed.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React, Anime.js
- **Styling**: CSS (with custom animations)
- **Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps
- **Build Tool**: Vite (or specify your tool)

## Features

- **Interactive Text Blurbs**: On the About page, text blurbs move with friction, velocity, and can be dragged to toss them around!
- **Falling Link Circles**: The Contact page features 20+ animated circles linking to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and more.
- **Highly Interactive UI**: Engaging animations and responsive design for a playful user experience.
