keep my mind sharp. I started with python and then moved to javascript, web devlopment and graphics. I have since learned how to
be a fullstack devloper makeing cool websites and applications. Picking up a few other languages along the way. I also took CS50 to
get a better understanding of computer science beyond my self-taught journey. And now I am here trying to push my skills further.`;

and what I can create . I am always looking for ways to better my creations. Constantly learning and improving, updating, iterating. That lead
me down a few interesting paths like learning C++ and Web Assembly actually designing things in figma. As a programmer I am creative, stuburn and
a bit of a perfectionist.`;

export const MainText3 = `For me programming is more than just code. It is art, its my brand. I want to create things that are not only functional but beautiful.
Something I can look back on and be proud of. A skill I want to push to its limits or my limits. Thats what code is to me. A proof of resolve and creativity.`;
