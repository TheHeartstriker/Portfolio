///////////////////////////////////////////////DynamicAnimations///////////////////////////////////////////////
export const BasicDynamicText = `A front end project that uses React, HTML canvas and complex logic
to create interactive and controllable dynamic animations. It
includes weather animations, falling sand simulations, Gravity
simulations and more. Deployed using azure.`;

export const DynamicAniGitText = `
Dynamic Animations

Description and usage:
This is a canvas and react project leveraging a heavy use of logic to create dynamic
and in some cases interactable animations.
The main goal is for someone to have fun messing around with the project and its respective simulations (:
In the case that a monitor is not being used it can be a great thing to just leave running on the side.

Technologies Used:
React, HTML Canvas, CSS, Javascript, Azure

Reasoning:
A big reason I made this project was to learn and develop my skills
and have fun while doing it. A plus is that I can share it here with you!
You can see the product of this skill if you look at this website's background.

export const ToDoAppGitText = `
Description and usage
This is a realtaivly simple todo app that I made. It has a backend and a frontend and uses a database to store tasks and folders.
It has user authentication and the ability to create, edit, and delete tasks. And does not require login to be used/tested.
It is deployed using an ec2 instance through AWS cloud using Caddy.

Technologies Used:
React, Node.js, Express, Mysql, JWT, Caddy, AWS, Typescript

Reasoning:
This is a todo app... aaaand that's it thank you for coming to my ted talk. 
Anyway yes this is a very common website but for learning purposes it was great I learned a lot about backend, system creation/development and how to safely do http requests and interact with a database. 
It has a fairly unique ui I think and more things then I think most would implement. Login, ids, folders, task names, task completion, and descriptions. 
I learned a ton during its creation and I am glad I did it.

///////////////////////////////////////////////FitnessApp///////////////////////////////////////////////

export const BasicFitnessAppText = `A full stack project that uses React, Node.js, express and mysql.
Gives the user and overview of their fitness progress tracking
total calories burned, time, zones, heartrate along with other
metrics. It also includes the ability to share data with others
also using or visiting the application. Deployed using an ec2
instance through AWS cloud using Caddy.`;

export const FitnessAppGitText = `
Description:
This app tracks a few simple metrics time, effort, weight and heartrate. It was meant to give a look at your overall fitness progress without wasting your time.
It tracks things like how much time you have spent in specific zones overall over a period of time and how many calories have you burned in that time.
Average heart rate, average weight etcetera. 
I find it nice to zoom out a bit and look at the total effort you have put in that's mainly what this app is.
A zoomed out look at what you or others with the share feature have done in a period of time.

Technologies Used:
React, Node.js, Express, Mysql, JWT, Caddy, AWS, Figma, D3.js, Javascript

Reasoning:
I like fitness and I noticed that there was a lot of fitness trackers and the like.
They do things along the line of tracking sets and or diet and while that's great on the surface I found that tracking sets can be easily tracked in notepad along with a diet.
I don't know if others ever felt the same but it kind of felt like a waste of time.
Further more diet trackers are hard to use. And they often include closed of ecosystem's in the form of an app, deit's, exercises it loses its purpose of tracking everything precisely.
So I wanted to make something that I would actually use and benefit from and maybe others would to. It was also a great way to test my skills in a more complex project.
