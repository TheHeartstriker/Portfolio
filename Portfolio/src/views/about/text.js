Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of hours honing my craft - designing websites, building applications, and writing about tech. My work is guided by balance, creativity, precision, and clarity.`;

 Whether it’s a creative website, a playful one, or something professional, this is reflected in my skills, my work, and the results I achieve. If you like what you see, you can hire me to do the same for you!`;

 I also listen to an almost ridiculous amount of music (about 2,000 hours a year). Beyond that, I enjoy learning new things, meeting new people, playing games and fitness. That’s pretty much me!`;
