and what I can create . I am always looking for ways to better my creations. Constantly learning and improving, updating, iterating. That lead
me down a few interesting paths like learning C++ and Web Assembly actually designing things in figma. As a programmer I am creative, stubborn and
a bit of a perfectionist.`;

export const MainText3 = `For me programming is more than just code. It's both art and part of my identity. I want to create things that are not only functional but beautiful.
Something I can look back on and be proud of. A skill I want to push to its limits or my limits at least. That's what code is to me. A reflection of both creativity and dedication.`;
