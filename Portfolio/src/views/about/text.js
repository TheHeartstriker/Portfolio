export const MainText2 = `I’ve built a lot of things, software, web apps, tech articles, and social posts. 
I always try to create something original, whether it’s a program worth talking about or an article I wish I had. When you look through my work, that’s what you’ll find: projects and content designed to be useful, creative, and a little different.`;

 I also listen to an almost ridiculous amount of music (about 2,000 hours a year). Beyond that, I enjoy learning new things, meeting new people, playing games and fitness. That’s pretty much me!`;
