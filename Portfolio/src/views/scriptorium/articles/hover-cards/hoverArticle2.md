I hope you enjoyed this! It was slightly different from my usual articles, simpler in a sense, but still fun. But I did want to link two subjects and examples of a 'pixel array' in use. Along with the codebase I made this in :)

- [Very popular code pen uses similar principles to this article](https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/KwPpdBZ)

- [Code for this article](https://github.com/TheHeartstriker/Myriad/tree/main/Myriad/src/cards)

Hope you have a great day! Bye bye :)
