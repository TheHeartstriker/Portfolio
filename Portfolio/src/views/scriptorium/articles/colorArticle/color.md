# How to chose color when designing a website

This article is going to cover colors! Specifically how to chose them when making a website. And how to chose them in a way that allow's you to follow feeling's, thems and ideas like calm, trust generating, elegance, playful or professional. Further more the goal is to showcase how to chose color's that work with real desing philophys, system's and rules like material UI, WAG and more.

## How to Pick Color's

When you design a website. One of the first things any professional does is define what it needs to convey. Perhpas that's professionalism and calm or playful and exciting. And in those cases you need to define color's that convery those emotions for playful perhaps it's dreamy color's like light pink and purple. Or green and yellow for playful and exciting, ecetra.

### Defining keywords

So let's start say we are making a high quality landscaping site made for a professional and we want to chose three color's. Two accents and a background color. But where do we start? Well let's define what a landscaping site should convey first. And say it should convey the following.

- Calm
- Trust
- Professionalism
- Warmth

Now that we have these lets chose three color's that convery these keywords. First let's use a little cheat sheet to help us define what feelings color's convey you can also use google our color picker's like [coolors](https://coolors.co/d405f4) this can both help you find color's and understand the pyscholgy and feelings of anycolor among many other usful things that website offers.

### Picking color's

So lets pick accents first then a background and for our first accent maybe we chose blue? That works it fits the keywords of calm, trust and professionalims but since it's a little cold and we are doing a landscaping site a better color might be green it's on brand and convery's life, growth, health and generally hit's our keywords primarly warmth, trust and calm.

Naturally lets chose our second accent. Currently we need something more trust generating and professional we have a exciting lively color but we need to balance it a bit. Orange would work but its a little loud so perhaps brown. It's on theme with landscaping and conveys stablity, warm and reliablity. Which pushes promotes what we are currently missing professionalism.

This is the easy part the background. This usualy split's into two camps for website's dark theme's and light theme's. And those usually are either a black or white for light and dark theme respectively. Now a dark theme is not at all what we want to convey the emotions are off. Naturally that mean's we need a light theme but pure white is cold, empty. And though backgrounds need to be neutral we can still add a splash of color. So what do we add?

Well we know we want white but lets add yellow giving us a tan or ivory color. It's no longer cold and empty and the feeling's it convery's is within our keywords while being a netural color.

### Basic color theory

Before we take our color's into the next section lets talk about color theory. The most important for design being warm vs cold, color system's, consitancy and common pit falls.

First lets go over warm vs cold color's. This is just a general guide to follow as you edit pick and chose color's your warm green can quickly be changed into a color light green. It's very usuful to keep in mind the seperations of color's cold and warm it's easy to get lost in the millions of varitions of green and cuting the options in half is usful even if your pallete is all cold color's there is still a difference between deep purple and light purple dark being warmer and light being colder. It can be usful to understand and balance what you want following these idea's espically when considering your background colors.

You will edit color's when you are chosing any professional is extemly picky about desing and coloring. And no you will never know every color or even remember a cupple color code's. But you will often pick a color you like and it's close but off. Maybe it's a tad to color or warm. And understanding what HSL mean's can be extemly helpful rather then just messing with a slider. In HSL hue is the color saturation is the purity of the color and lightness is self explantry. The most imporant of these is saturation and lightness. If you need to change hue it's likaly best to find another color. As for saturation messing and understanding these can help you cool or warm color's up without really changing them. Now lightness is abvious so lets talk about saturation you can think of it as purity how intensly brough foward the hue is and at zero we are only dealing with lightness so black or white. And lightness is how dark a color is this is not acurate but you can think of it like adding white or black drops of paint into a color.

Now lastly something I strugled with when starting is color relationship's like complemtery, analogous, triadic and mostly these are distractions. Chose accent's based on feeling the background is mostly netural in most website's further more you are not merging the color's they are usually seperate. Chose based on how they feel and that usualy naturally make's them fit together allog with general rules you have to follow usualy everything matches well. But there is edge cases if your going for a very colorful website or something general esoteric maybe with no neturals or multiple accents for something like a portfolio then understand true color thoery is 100% needed but in 99% of cases realtionships can be ignored.

## What a design needs

We have our primarly's but we have yet to make shade's and truly pick the exact color code we want. But first there is a few rule's, system's and guidlines we will use when finalizng our color that I want to go over. Understanding these will also show you how to apply color's in a website.

### Readablity and Contrast

First readablity. This mean's your accent's colors and text color's must be easily visable when placed over your backgrond color or color's. Giving a quick example say we chose a light scheme and the background color is white. First our text color's would be two shade's of black naturally contrast well. But! Accent's are also often used as text color's for important heading's. So your accents must be clearly visable above your background. There is even a scale for this called [WAG](https/) but remember only your accent's and text color compared to your background must pass WAG.

### Hierarchy

If there is one word to encompase how to make a good design its higherarchy. And of course this encompases color's as well and is something we should understand when picking color's and applying them. Now the most important thing to understand is depth/elevation and balance

Now first let's discuse balance. Consitncy is also one of the most important thing's in design and knowing when to use color is important if you use to much of a accent or to little your entire website can seem unbalnced either in that its bland and not impactful or to impactful both of these cases attention is not flowing where you want it. User's ignore your heading's or call to actions because they don't pop out. Even if you chose great accent's and background color's and shade's this can still happen. And the best way to avoid it is to follow a rule or idea called the 60/30/10 rule. This is all about percentage's of color 60% of your website is your background and the 30% and 10% are your two accent's. Following something like this can make sure your color's, page's, buttons, heading's are impactful.

Something else to note first the 60/30/10 does not need to be mathmaticaly followed its just a framework for how often to use color there is even different varations. Like the 80/20 rule or even fliping the rule in certain area's like making your 60% swap with your 10% to add some extra ecitment, flexablity and uniqeness to a design.

Now onto elevation. This is something in material UI where more important item's should feel closer to the user there is many way's to do this. But here its about making sure our color's increase in elevation visually as they get rarer for example if we have a white and dark green if that dark green is ontop of the white if feels closer its contrast's well and is less common visually then the white so it's 'higher' in the 2d design.

## Creating a pallete

We have picked our color's and defined what rule's they need to follow so now lets actual pick shade's to actual create our palletes.

### Background shade's

Now backgrounds are a large portion of our website since we are following the 60/30/10 rule they are around 60%. But again that 60% does not need to be a single color so lets make a few tan shade's. But before getting into that let's go into the process of actually finding shade's we can't just matarilaze a tan out of thousands of possiblitys. So for most color picking and editing I am again using coolors [Coolors](https/).

So we want tan so I found E6DAB3 on Coolors its nice it has a old paper look and follow's our theme. But say we want a card to sit above this tan but we don't want to use our accent's because perhap's it will violate the 60/30/10 rule or maybe it just does not look good. For this we create shade's at least three color's that are whiter then out current color but not two different that they seem like a completly diffenrt color because that would violate the 60/30/10 rule. So we use HSL and decrease lightness by 7 percent twice to get two more color's getting these three F7F5E9, EFE8D2 and E6DAB3.

![Color Shades](/)

And now we have our background it subtle and fit's while being balanced and netural. We can even flip this currently the darkest shade is the main background then lighter shade's can sit ontop but there is no problem doing the reverse either it's still balanced follow's our rule's and they subtly stand out.

### Accents

So we want to now pick out accent shade's. Knowing that first they must contrast against our background and somewhat against each other. Now as for against each other part sometimes we might layer the accent's so it's important that they at least are somewhat passible when they are layered. This part really depends on design choice.

But how do we pick our color's we want brown and green. The best way is to simply browse palletes find something you like our somewhat like then use that or edit or find very similar shade's that seem perfect. Make sure they past contrast before doing anything else something that can help here is keeping in mind warm vs cold and you background color. Then lastly visually test all variations against your accents. Like so.

![Color Shades](/)

What we are doing here is testing all passible background's for every accent so for our green we test against our three background shade's and do the same for brown. And if it passes all these's tests visually then your color's.

### Side note

Often when start using your pallete even after doing all the mentioned test it can feel of or wrong when in actual use. And in that case as long as it still contrast's well and is the same general color's as you orginally(green, brown and tan) then you can change on the fly or mid design is safe. People do it often just long as you still follow the orginal color's, rules and thoughts so you don't move away from your keywords without thinking it through.

## Conclusion

Chosing color's is hard. Everyone say's different thing's and for me noboddy actually talked about the fundemntals like needing a netural background, contrast and balance and those who did showed boring website's or a system with no flexablity or just collapsed with common rules people use. And I hope this article layed out the most important fundemntals so you don't have to guess around like I did and in a way that you can edit and grow what I showed here. Otherwise have a good day! And look around a bit my portfolio is many other instresting things!
