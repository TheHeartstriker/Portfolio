# How to chose color when designing a website

This article is going to cover colors! Specifically how to chose them when making a website. And how to chose them in a way that allow's you to follow feeling's, thems and ideas like calm, trust generating, elegance, playful or professional. Further more the goal is to showcase how to chose color's that work with real desing philophys, system's and rules like material UI, WAG and more.

## How to Pick Color's

When you design a website. One of the first things any professional does is define what it needs to convey. Perhpas that's professionalism and calm or playful and exciting. And in those cases you need to define color's that convery those emotions for playful perhaps it's dreamy color's like light pink and purple.

### Defining keywords

So let's start say we are making a high quality landscaping site made for a professional and we want to chose three color's. Two accents and a background color. But where do we start? Well let's define what a landscaping site should convey first. And generally is should convery the following.

- Calm
- Trust
- Professionalism
- Warmth

Now that we have these lets chose three color's that convery these keywords. First let's use a little cheat sheet to help us define what feelings color's convey. There will also be free resources at the end to help you.

### Picking color's

So for our first accent maybe we chose blue? That works it fits the keywords of calm, trust and professionalims but since it's landscaping a better color might be green it's on brand and convery's life, growth, health and generally hit's our keywords primarly warmth and trust.

Now lets chose another accent. We need something more trust generating and professional we have a exciting color but we need to balance it a bit. Orange would work but its a little loud so perhaps brown. It's on theme with landscaping and conveys stablity, warm and reliablity. Which we are currently missing.

This is the hard part the background. This usualy split's into two camps for website's dark theme's and light theme's. And those usually are either a black and or grey for dark and a white and or grey for light theme. Now a dark theme is not at all what we want to convey the emotions are off. Naturally that mean's we need a light theme but pure white is cold, empty while grey is a little lifeless. So what do we pick?

Well many designed website's go with the classic white or black depending on theme but add a splash of color. And that's what we are going to do here picking a white with a little yellow to get a old paper look. Its soothing and most importantly hit's all our keywards by itself.

### Basic color theory

Before we take our color's into the next section lets talk about color theory. Now here many of the important note's realted to design will be directally covered in the next section.

But some a few imporant general subject's are warm vs cold color's, color system's and consitnacy.

First lets go over warm vs cold color's. This is just a general guide to follow as you edit pick and chose color's your warm green can quickly be changed into a color light green. It's very usuful to keep in mind the seperations of color's cold and warm it's easy to get lost in the millions of varitions of green and cuting the options in half is usful.

You will edit color's when you are chosing any professional is extemly picky about desing and coloring. And no you will never know every color or even remember a cupple color code's. But you will often pick a color you like and it's close but off. Maybe it's a tad to color or warm. And understanding what HSL mean's can be extemly helpful rather then just messing with a slider. In HSL hue is the color saturation is the purity of the color and lightness is self explantry.

The most imporant of these is saturation and lightness. If you need to change hue it's likaly best to find another color. As for saturation messing and understanding these can help you cool or warm color's up without really changing them. Now lightness is abvious so lets talk about saturation you can think of it as purity how intensly brough foward the hue is and at zero we are only dealing with lightness so black or white. And lightness is how dark a color is this is not acurate but you can think of it like adding white or black drops of paint into a color.

Now lastly something I strugled with when starting is color relationship's like complemtery, analogous, triadic and mostly these are distractions. Chose accent's based on feeling the background is mostly netural in most website's further more you are not merging the color's they are usually seperate. Chose based on how they feel and that usualy naturally make's them fit together. There is also many rule's you have to follow as you create a color pallete for a website that further make them work together.

## What a design needs

We have our primarly's but we have yet to make shade's and truly pick the exact color we want. But first there is a few rule's, system's and guidlines we will use when finalizng our color that I want to go over.

### Readablity and Contrast

First readablity. This mean's your accent's colors and text color's must be easily visable we placed over your backgrond color or color's. Before we move on let's go over text color's in 90% of all cases these are two or three shade's of white or black depending on weather you are making a light or dark scheme you use multiple because you want often want to empithise or dempithise certain text.

Giving a quick example if we chose a light scheme and the background color is white. First our text color's two shade's of black naturally contrast well. But! Accent's are also often used as text color's for important heading's. So your accents must be clearly visable above your background. There is even a scale for this called [WAG](https/) but remember only your accent's and text color compared to your background must pass WAG.

### Hierarchy

If there is one word to encompase how to make a good website its higherarchy. And of course this encompases color's as well and is something we should prorities when picking color's. Now the based way to do this is through depth/elevation and rarity/balance.

Lets first discuse rarity and balance many site's follow a rule system called the 60/30/10 rule. Where 60% of the site is one color 30% is another and the last is 10%. Usually the 60% is the background and the 30 and 10 are your accent's using this balance's allowing attention to flow naturally the user will naturally know feel the flow of importance 60% is duller less rare and is low in herarchy drawing less attention the your 30% and 10%. But there are few things to keep in mind first for example 60% does not specfically need to be one color it can be a shade's of very similar color's.

Now contrast and depth. This idea's is taken from materialy UI and is very similar to the last section. In that more important elements should feel closer to the user.
