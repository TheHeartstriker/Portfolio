# How to Choose Color When Designing a Website

This article is going to cover colors! Specifically, how to choose them when making a website, and how to choose them in a way that allows you to follow feelings, themes, and ideas like calm, trust-generating, elegance, playful, or professional. Furthermore, the goal is to showcase how to choose colors that work with real design philosophies, systems, and rules like Material UI, WCAG, and more.

## How to Pick Colors

When you design a website, one of the first things any professional does is define what it needs to convey. Perhaps that's professionalism and calm, or playful and exciting. In those cases, you need to define colors that convey those emotions. For playful, perhaps it's dreamy colors like light pink and purple, or green and yellow for playful and exciting, etc.

### Defining Emotions

So let's start by saying we are making a high-quality landscaping site made for a professional, and we want to choose three colors: two accents and a background color. But where do we start? Well, let's define what a landscaping site should convey first, and say it should convey the following.

- Calm
- Trust
- Professionalism
- Warmth

Now that we have these, let's choose three colors that convey these emotions. First, let's use a little cheat sheet to help us define what feelings colors convey. You can also use Google or color pickers like [coolors](https://coolors.co/d405f4). This can both help you find colors and understand the psychology and emotions of any color, among many other useful things that website offers.

### Picking Initial Colors

So let’s pick accents first, then a background, and for our first accent maybe we choose blue? That works; it fits the feelings of calm, trust, and professionalism. But since it’s a little cold and we are doing a landscaping site, a better color might be green. It’s on brand and conveys life, growth, health, and generally hits our emotions, primarily warmth, trust, and calm.

Naturally, let’s choose our second accent. Currently, we need something more trust-generating and professional. We have an exciting, lively color, but we need to balance it a bit. Orange would work, but it’s a little loud, so perhaps brown. It’s on theme with landscaping and conveys stability, warmth, and reliability, which promotes what we are currently missing: professionalism.

This is the easy part: the background. This usually splits into two camps for websites: dark themes and light themes. And those usually are either black or white for light and dark themes, respectively. Now, a dark theme is not at all what we want; the emotions are off. Naturally, that means we need a light theme, but pure white is cold and empty. And though backgrounds need to be neutral, we can still add a splash of color. So what do we add?

Well, we know we want white, but let’s add yellow, giving us a tan or ivory color. It’s no longer cold and empty, and the feelings it conveys are within our emotions while being a neutral color.

### Basic Color Theory

Before we take our colors into the next section, let’s talk about color theory. This will guide you when picking shades and understanding and working around color rules and limitations in designs. The most important aspects of color theory in design are warm vs. cold, color systems, consistency, and common pitfalls.

First, let’s go over warm vs. cold colors. This is just a general guide to follow as you edit, pick, and choose colors. Your warm green can quickly be changed into a cool light green. It’s very useful to keep in mind the separation of colors into cold and warm; it’s easy to get lost in the millions of variations of green, and cutting the options in half is useful. Even if your palette is all cold colors, there is still a difference between deep purple and light purple, with darker being warmer and lighter being colder. It can be useful to understand and balance what you want, following these ideas, especially when considering your background colors.

You will edit colors when you are choosing; any professional is extremely picky about design and coloring. And no, you will never know every color or even remember a couple color codes. But you will often pick a color you like, and it’s close but off. Maybe it’s a tad too cool or warm. And understanding what HSL means can be extremely helpful rather than just messing with a slider. In HSL, hue is the color, saturation is the purity of the color, and lightness is self-explanatory. The most important of these are saturation and lightness. If you need to change hue, it’s likely best to find another color. As for saturation, messing with and understanding this can help you cool or warm colors up without really changing them. Now lightness is obvious, so let’s talk about saturation. You can think of it as purity - how intensely brought forward the hue is - and at zero, we are only dealing with lightness, so black or white. And lightness is how dark a color is; this is not accurate, but you can think of it like adding white or black drops of paint into a color.

Now lastly, something I struggled with when starting is color relationships like complementary, analogous, triadic, and mostly these are distractions. Choose accents based on feeling; the background is mostly neutral in most websites. Furthermore, you are not merging the colors; they are usually separate. Choose based on how they feel, and that usually naturally makes them fit together, along with general rules you have to follow. Usually everything matches well. But there are edge cases - if you’re going for a very colorful website or something generally esoteric, maybe with no neutrals or multiple accents(4 or more) for something like a portfolio - then understanding true color theory is 100% needed. But in 99% of cases, true color relationships can be ignored.

## What a Design Needs

Now that we've picked based on feeling, let's make sure they actually work on a site

We have our primaries, but we have yet to make shades and truly pick the exact color codes we want. But first, there are a few rules, systems, and guidelines we will use when finalizing our colors that I want to go over. Understanding these will also show you how to apply colors in a website.

### Readablity and Contrast

First, readability. This means your accent colors and text colors must be easily visible when placed over your background color or colors. Giving a quick example: say we choose a light scheme and the background color is white. First, our text colors would be two shades of black, naturally contrasting well. But accents are also often used as text colors for important headings, so your accents must be clearly visible above your background. There is even a scale for this called [WCAG](https/), but remember only your accents and text colors compared to your background must pass WCAG.

### Color Hierarchy

If there is one word to encompass how to make a good design, it’s hierarchy. And of course, this encompasses colors as well and is something we should understand when picking colors and applying them. The most important things to understand are depth/elevation and balance.

First, let’s discuss balance. Imagine you use too much of an accent or too little; your entire website can seem unbalanced - either in that it’s bland and not impactful, or too impactful because your impactful colors (accents) are being randomly applied without consistency or balance. This causes attention to not flow where you want it. Users ignore your headings or call to actions because they don’t pop out. Even if you choose great accents and background colors and shades, this can still happen. The best way to avoid it is to follow a rule or idea called the 60/30/10 rule. This is all about percentages of color: 60% of your website is your background, and the 30% and 10% are your two accents. Following something like this can make sure your colors, pages, buttons, and headings stay consistent, impactful, and balanced.

Something else to note on balance and the 60/30/10 rule: first, the 60/30/10 does not need to be mathematically followed; it’s just a framework for how often to use color. There are even different variations, like the 80/20 rule, or even flipping the rule in certain areas, such as making your 60% swap with your 10% to add some extra excitement, flexibility, and uniqueness to a design. It’s called a rule, but it’s really a guideline.

Now onto elevation. This is something in Material UI, where more important items should feel closer to the user. There are many ways to do this, but here it’s about making sure our colors increase in elevation visually as they get rarer. For example, if we have a white and dark green, if that dark green is on top of the white, it feels closer, it contrasts well, and is less common visually than the white, so it’s “higher” in the 2D design.

## Creating a Palette

We have picked our colors and defined what rules they need to follow, so now let’s actually pick shades to create our palettes.

### Background Shades

Now backgrounds are a large portion of our website; since we are following the 60/30/10 rule, they are around 60%. But again, that 60% does not need to be a single color, so let’s make a few tan shades. But before getting into that, let’s go into the process of actually finding shades - we can’t just materialize a tan out of thousands of possibilities. So for most color picking and editing, I am again using [Coolors](https/).

So we want tan, so I found E6DAB3 on Coolors. It’s nice; it has an old paper look and follows our theme. But say we want a card to sit above this tan, and we don’t want to use our accents because perhaps it will violate the 60/30/10 rule, or maybe it just does not look good. For this, we create shades - at least three colors that are whiter than our current color but not too different that they seem like a completely different color, because that would violate the 60/30/10 rule. So we use HSL and decrease lightness by 7 percent twice to get two more colors, getting these three: F7F5E9, EFE8D2, and E6DAB3.

![Color Shades](/)

And now we have our background. It’s subtle and fits while being balanced and neutral. We can even flip this: currently, the darkest shade is the main background, then lighter shades can sit on top, but there is no problem doing the reverse either. It’s still balanced, follows our rules, and the shades subtly stand out.

### Accents

So we want to now pick out accent shades, knowing that first they must contrast against our background and somewhat against each other. Now, as for the “against each other” part, sometimes we might layer the accents themselves across each other, so it’s important that they at least are somewhat passable when they are layered, but this part really depends on design choice.

But how do we pick our colors? We want brown and green. The best way is to simply browse palettes, find something you like or somewhat like, then use that or edit or find very similar shades that seem perfect. Make sure they pass contrast before doing anything else. Something that can help here is keeping in mind warm vs. cold and your background color.

### Testing

Now we have everything - backgrounds and accents that contrast well against them. That's it, right? We can move forward! Well, no. Just because theoretically everything seems well, there is still visual testing needed. Usually, that means making something to test all variations you might or will use, like so.

![Color Shades](/)

What we are doing here is testing all possible variations in a card-like format, seeing our color limitations, strengths, and general visual aesthetics (ps, it’s also a great place to test fonts!).

Now often, when starting to use your palette, even after doing all the mentioned tests, it can feel off or wrong when in actual use. And in that case, as long as it still contrasts well and is the same general colors as you originally (green, brown, and tan), then you can change on the fly or mid-design safely. People do it often, just as long as you still follow the original colors, rules, and thoughts so you don’t move away from your keywords without thinking it through.

## Conclusion

Choosing colors is hard. Everyone says different things, and for me, nobody actually talked about the fundamentals like needing a neutral background, contrast, and balance. And those who did showed boring websites or a system with no flexibility, or just collapsed with common rules people use. I hope this article laid out the most important fundamentals so you don’t have to guess around like I did, and in a way that you can edit and grow what I showed here. Otherwise, have a good day! And look around a bit - my portfolio has many other interesting things!
