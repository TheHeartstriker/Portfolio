# What a backend looks like Javascript, Express and Node.

This article is going to go over the backend! More spefically what a simple backend looks like, how everything fit's together with a database and most importantly folder structures. We are going
to go over each folder of a common backend and discuse why they exist, what they do and how they tie in with the frontend.

## Why this matter's //Add learning how to read

The general goal is for you to understand at a high level how a backend works even regardless of the tooling we are going to use(Express and node). But at the same time not to such a high level that you don't actually understand what a backend look's like. When I was getting into backend it was hard to find something that really showed me what a backend was through code. So to do that here I am going to go over each marjor backend directory and files those being the entry point, routing, middleware and controler's showing what each part does what it's code looks like, why itâ€™s there, and how its expanded upon in more advanced settings.

## What is the backend?

The backend in a fullstack app is a comminication point between the database and the frontend. A middle man that in the end is just a collection of endpoint's.
For example say you have a backend server url it looks like so `server-url/api/login` the frontend send's a POST request to `api/login` using [HTTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http) the backend then receives that request then does something based on our logic.

Using the same example that POST request might check the data base to see if a username is in use and return true or false to the frontend depending on the result. Or rather then comnicate with designated database it could even send request's to other server's/backend's instead!

## Entry point

What is a entry point? Well here in express its a place to both apply's setting's to our server and start it! Consider the following code

```javascript
import express from "express";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";
//Middleware
import errorHandler from "./middleWare/errorMiddleWare.js";
import limiter from "./middleWare/rateMiddleWare.js";
import corsMiddleware from "./middleWare/corsMiddleWare.js";
//Routes
import routes from "./routes.js";

//Configures the environment variables and express
dotenv.config();
const app = express();

//Middleware
app.use(corsMiddleware);
app.use(limiter);
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cookieParser());

//routes
app.use("/api", routes);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Let's walk through it starting at `dotenv.config` downward. First the line itself configure's dotenv which are varables for the entire server. Think of integeral data for our backend like where is the database? What's said databases password? Username? What about the location of the frontend? What is our data enyption keys? All very important information that is sensitive and subject to change. Changes like a switch from a test database to a live one and sensitive meaning that if someone has the encyption key they could falsify data or or if they have the database sign in they can steal all our data! So .env acts as a safe storage container basically. And `dotenv.config` allows our server to access our .env file.

The next line intalizes the express app. After that we get to the middleware but what is middleware? It's kind of like a layer before data passes through to something. This middleware is located at the root meaning all data must pass through our root middleware layer before getting to our routes. Some middleware like [CORS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cross-origin-resource-sharing/) and our rate limiter act as sucritey for our backend like gandolf! While others things like `express.json()` and `cookieParser` put certain data under convenient names like all incoming requests that have [cookie's](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies) put said data under `req.cookies`. More on the usage's of middleware later.

Now after passing through our middelware we get to `app.use("/api", routes)` which is saying every request to `backendUrl/api` use the routes file to locate your endpoint for example `backendUrl/api/login` lookes into routes for a listener for `/login` which then provide's or request to our controller. This allows for sepration of concerns quite litterally like folders or directorys alowing us to orgnaize our api as such.

But what about `app.listen`? Well this start's or server at port 3000 or if present out .env's PORT value so we actually find our backend at something like so `backendUrl:3000/api`.

## Routes

Now let walk through routes! Probably the simplest part of this entire thing here is an example.

```javascript
import { Router } from "express";
import { login, register } from "./Controllers/authController.js";

const routes = Router();

routes.post("/login", login);
routes.post("/register", register);

export default routes;
```

Lets consider or previous example through `routes.post("/login", login);` say we make a request to our backend to the point `backendUrl:3000/api/login` it goes through our global middleware defined in the entry point and since it has `/api` it goes through routes as mentiond in the previous section.
Then if it finds a match passes the request body to the route which in this case immeditaly passes the request to our controler function login but more on controlers later! Now something important to note is that a match must posses both the name `/login` and the HTTP type. For the sake of example consider the following.

```javascript
routes.post("/login", login1);
routes.get("/login", login2);
```

These are both different routes. A post request at `/login` passes it request to the login1 controler and a get request to login will pass its request to login2. This is done for one big reason seperation of concerns. Endpoint's and api's typically do one thing that's it. For example a POST to `/register` would provide user data that is then inserted into the database while a post to `/login` might check login info against existing records. Now another thing to note is this can be chained in express. For example say you send a COOKIE and [json web token](https://www.jwt.io/introduction#what-is-json-web-token-structure) along with a request body you would want to validate the request before it get's to the controller. And in that case you would slap some middleware in that route like so.

```javascript
routes.get("/getData", auth, loadData);
```

So here it would look and function like so request -> auth -> loadData. And since our middlware here auth is a true or false deal if that fails or request never get's to our controller loadData it just returns a error to the frontend. And something to note in larger applications your api routing work's like frontend directorys simply put folder's sorted by purpose. Your `/api` router would link to other routers like a tree.

## Middleware

We have somewhat gone over what middleware which is a layer. But what this layer trully? Well its just code that does 'something' to incoming data. Sometimes that's data modification, rate limiting check's, authorization or error handling usually it represent's doing a action to a request before it reach's the main controler logic. Sometimes this is global like checking every request to see if they follow's our CORS setting's. Othertimes it's spefic to certain routes like authorizing GET request before fetching data for a user. Here is one of the most common middleware's in any backend.

```javascript
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

function auth(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const token = req.cookies?.jwtToken;
    if (!token) {
      return res
        .status(401)
        .json({ message: "Authentication required", success: false });
    }

    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res
      .status(401)
      .json({ message: "Invalid or expired token", success: false });
  }
}
```

This is a authoirization middleware for a protected route so imagine our fronted request's data to a route that looks like so `routes.get("/getData", auth, loadData);` we added or auth middleware before our controller defining this route as 'protected' so any request has to pass through or auth first to see if the credintials are valid if they are we pass it onward using `next();` which in this case passes it to `loadData` otherwise send back a error. It in a whole would look like this Request -> auth -> loadData -> response. In our middleware here we validate data by decoding our request data using or web token key. This also show's you how convient and required a .env file is we can change access key often while also keeping it safe!

Now let's show you a global middelware I glossed over at the start. Consider this line `app.use(corsMiddleware);` let see what the corsMiddleware looks like.

```javascript
import cors from "cors";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const corsOptions = {
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  methods: "GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE",
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 204,
};

const corsMiddleware = cors(corsOptions);

export default corsMiddleware;
```

All this does it implement CORS to every incoming request in our entry point through `app.use(corsMiddleware);`. The idea behind middelware is not that its a function, or secruity it's that middelware is code that does something to a request's at certain points in its journey. Sometimes that's stopping it othertimes it putting cookies under .cookies sometimes it's a error handler.

## Controller's

Controller's(sometimes also called services or modules) are arguably the most important part of a backend. We have went over everything that happens before reaching this point but what is a controller? Well it's just a function that completes api logic sometimes that's inserting data, deleting data or checking up on data like seeing if a payment has gone through. You can think of a api request to a endpoint as a function call and the request body as the function paramater's and the controller is the function itself. So let's see one that comnicates with a database :)

```javascript
import db from "../../db.js"; // Assume db is a configured mysql2/promise connection

// Gets the share info for the user
async function getShareInfo(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const userId = req.user.id;
    const [rows] = await db.execute(
      "SELECT share FROM dailyfitinfo WHERE userid = ? LIMIT 1",
      [userId]
    );
    if (!rows || rows.length === 0) {
      return res
        .status(404)
        .json({ message: "No record found for user", success: false });
    }

    res.status(200).json({ success: true, shared: rows[0].share });
  } catch (error) {
    //next(error) represents sending unknown error's to a global error handling software for later review
    next(error);
  }
}
```

This is a very simple controller function we send over the userId in the request and then using our id we send a query to our database. All our query does is pick a peice of data and we return the true or false .share value in our reponse(res).

But all controller dont just talk's directally to a database some fetch data from other service's. For example you might make a request from another service's to check payment information or maybe you want to get data from spotify? In both those's cases you follow that api's documentation make your request and then have data to presumembly send to a frontend to display! Although as you can imagine all the payment service or spotify is doing is requesting data from thier own database.

And just like routes each controller live's it own folder under `/controllers` seperated by purpose. Most of the time you would seperate folder's based on how you seperate your routes so they both have the same corisponding folder's.

### Our database

But we glossed over `db` and how we conminicate with our personal database. So what is `db`? Well here we use MySql as our database and to write query's and receive date from our database we need to connect to it and use some sort of method to send a sql query over. Here we are using the mysql2 npm package which allows us to connect to a MySql database and send query's over. And the connection is represented as `db` it looks like so.

```javascript
import mysql from "mysql2/promise";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const db = mysql.createPool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER, // e.g. "root"
  password: process.env.DB_PASS, // password
  database: process.env.DB_NAME, // db name
  waitForConnections: true,
  connectionLimit: 10,
  queueLimit: 0,
});

export default db;
```

All db really is a pool of connections to the database and when you write sql using `db.` it choses a connection from our pool for you to send and recevie information from your database. We use a connection pool for a few reason first so we are not opening and closing connections constantly, we can handle multiple request's concurrently and we also add limiter's(10 here) so our database never get's overloaded. You also of course need to provide your connection information so mysql2 can locate the database and login as a user. Which happens to be sensitive information so we put that inside of .env as well! Most all api's connect to a database in some way and they all have some connection or config file like this.

## What else you might see

Backend is complex way more then what I can put here. There are so many layer's to it just like frontend! But before I wrap this up I wanted to add show a bit more commonly seen backend practice's so you never get lost. This will espically help any frontend dev's so let get into it.

### Orm's

Often time's production level backend's don't usually use query's to commnicate with there database. Instead using 'pre built' query's they are called an used like any js function but convert into sql query's that use the paramater's and data you provided them. The control function I showed would look like so using a common MySql ORM sequalise.

```javascript
async function getShareInfo(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const userId = req.user.id;
    //New part ORM part!
    const sharedRecord = await dailyfitinfo.findOne({
      where: {
        userid: userId,
      },
    });
    //End
    if (!sharedRecord || sharedRecord.length === 0) {
      return res
        .status(404)
        .json({ message: "No record found for user", success: false });
    }

    res.status(200).json({ success: true, shared: sharedRecord.share });
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
}
```

Okay, so this look's simpler then before but why even bother with a ORM at all. First they are faster to code with, more compatible and more sercure. What do I mean by compatiblity and sucrity? Well many ORM's work with many different database's so switching to a different database won't immeditally break all of your backend.
Now sucrity this is a big one first all your query's validate data automtically so no acidently inserting incorect data. Along with this it has a few helpful side effect's like preventing SQL injection and handling table relationship's in code which leads into ORM's model's!

And one of the biggest part's of a ORM is model's think of a model as a defintion for each table in your database it defines the table's name, row name, primary key's, type's, uniquenss and many more. Basically the same as what someone would do by writing query's but instead using javascript making it easier and faster to work with. One of the biggest things this help's with is type checking you can't insert wrong type's and it generally inforces thing's according to you model's so happy little accident's while coding end up highlighted! Here is a super simple and short example of a user model

```javascript
import { DataTypes, Sequelize } from "sequelize";
import ConfigDb from "../config/configDb.js"; //Sequalize connection very similar to db in previous examples
//
// User model
//
const User = ConfigDb.define("User", {
  UserName: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true,
  },
  Password: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
});

export default User;
```

Now remember just like routes and controlker models usually get their own folder's. Each representing a table in you database you can strucure this the same as you do your controller, and route's for example all auth related models being under `models/auth`. Keeping things easily accessable between those portions of the backend.

### Data validation

Now something else that can add to backend complexity to a backend in code, files and directorys is data validation. We touched on this in ORM's by preventing the insertion of invalid data and checking syntax but this goes much deeper. First a big concept in backend is never trusting incoming data to defend against attck's possible error's when inserting data or sending it of elsewhere for reponses. We enforce this by type checking incoming data so many backend's use something like a npm package called zod. This then lead's to another folder called pipe's(or name's like validation maybe schema) when you define your zod scheme's and a zod scheme is pretty much a model for incoming api request data.
