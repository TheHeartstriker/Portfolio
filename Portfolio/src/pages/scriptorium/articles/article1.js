# Subject
The goal of this article is to introduce creative coding. The focus will be on a particle system and how to use logic, math and programming to create something in nature.
It's a great way to practice fundamentals and improve problem solving skills because you see the results of your work in real time. Although this is just an example / baseline with this
after this hopefully you will have the tools to create anything you want things such as lightning, fire, wind the possibilities are endless.

## Creating a particle system
Here we are creating a particle we are going to model gravity, friction, force and more. First lets define the most fundamental part of a pysics system, the vector. 
If you want to use formulas and model real forces you need to understand vectors. I will not go into much detail about vectors but I will provide a link to reasources at the end of this article.
Here is a vector class that I created to start with. For simplicity I will not be using a compiled language so here JS.

\`\`\`
  class Vector {
    constructor(x, y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
    }
    add(v) {
      return new Vector(this.x + v.x, this.y + v.y);
    }
    sub(v) {
      return new Vector(this.x - v.x, this.y - v.y);
    }
    mult(scalar) {
      return new Vector(this.x * scalar, this.y * scalar);
    }
    div(scalar) {
      return new Vector(this.x / scalar, this.y / scalar);
    }
    mag() {
      return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y);
    }
    normalize() {
      const mag = this.mag();
      if (mag > 0) {
        return this.div(mag);
      }
      return new Vector(0, 0);
    }
} 
\`\`\`
Now the most important part of a particle system the particle itself. Once we create this class we can start applying forces to create the effect we want.
Here is the model I created for a particle.
\`\`\`
  class Particle {
    constructor(x, y, mass) {
      this.position = new Vector(x, y);
      this.velocity = new Vector(0, 0);
      this.mass = mass;
      this.radius = radius;
    }

    applyForce(force) {
      forceCopy = force;
      forceCopy = forceCopy.div(this.mass);
      this.acceleration.add(forceCopy);
    }

    update() {
      this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
      this.position.add(this.velocity);
      this.acceleration.mult(0);
    }

    draw(ctx) {
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.arc(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
      ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
      ctx.fill();
      ctx.closePath();
    }
  }
\`\`\`
Now using applyForce we can apply forces to any particle. Now the next part is going to be prett common place simplyfing these formulas to make them easier to use.
For example the universal gravitation formula is: F = G(m1m2)/rÂ². We simply dont need that here it talks about the force of attraction between two objects. We just want a downward force.
So we will incorporate mass and constant for gravity. Now the next is friction. f = uN the u aka the friction coefficient is constant we are not simulating a surface or other object like ice or rubber.
Its just a imgainary circle. Now the normal force is something we can easily calculate and keeps this example simple the normal force is equal to the mass of the object times gravity. So we can use this to calculate the friction force.
