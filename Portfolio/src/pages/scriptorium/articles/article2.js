# Mapping a Full Stack Application
This article is going to go over system design its a high level overview going over what I think are the most important steps in the process of using a fullstack application. There is going to three sections, first is serving code
this will go over what happens when you visit a fullstack application, the second is logging in this is a smaller section but in most fullstack applications being logged is fundamental the third section is common opperations
this section is going to go over what happens when someone logs in and is using the application, where does jwt fit? Cookies? Cors?
